# ModQueue - Content Moderation Platform

## Project Overview
A full-stack content moderation platform where users can submit posts and admins can approve/reject content, manage users, and view analytics.

**Goal**: Build a portfolio-worthy project demonstrating full-stack skills, Docker, Git, and real-world features that companies care about.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Version Control**: Git

## Learning Approach
- Student writes all code first
- Claude guides with questions and explanations
- Focus on understanding, not just working code
- Debug together without complete solutions

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic Flask server setup (server.py)
- 🔄 Next: Initialize Git repository
- ⏳ Pending: Database setup, user authentication, admin dashboard

## Architecture Decisions
*To be filled as we make decisions...*

## Key Files
- `server.py` - Flask application entry point
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file (project context for Claude)

## Setup Instructions
*To be filled once we have more setup...*

## Token Usage Strategy
- Start fresh conversations for distinct features/phases
- Current conversation: Project setup & planning
- **Start new session when**: Token usage hits ~50%, or when switching to a major new feature (e.g., frontend build, Docker setup)
- This document persists across sessions - update it as you build!

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Git repository
2. Create initial commit
3. Plan database schema (users, posts, moderation status)
4. Set up PostgreSQL connection
